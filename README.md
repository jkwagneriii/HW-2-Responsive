Unit 2 Css and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio 

I began building responsive webpage homework by referencing the supplied photos and writing down what I believed each element to be.

Starting with the navbar made the most sense knowing that html is read from top to bottom. After choosing a general nav bar with at least one link, I went into the  html code and changed the text information as well as adding two identical links.

I wanted to work on the CSS along side each successful element, so once the navbar was mostly where it needed to be, I went into the CSS to adjust the colors, spacing, margin, padding, and font. The font came from Google Fonts.

I used a jumbotron as the central display element for each html page. Similar to the navbar, after commenting out different elements to see what they do, I moved tags around for what I needed on each page. 

After using the jumbotron for the index page, I knew what I needed to plug and what I needed to remove for the portfolio and contact pages.

The trickiest issue I ran into while coding this was my images and text elements overlapping when decreasing the screen size. After a tutor session with Tom, I understood that I needed to change the image width to a percentage rather than a pixel when working inside a responsive column.

I really enjoyed working with restrictions but being able to add my own look to the homework. When working with Tom, he told me that some people specialize in CSS after the bootcamp and that they are valued on teams because so many people don't like doing that part. So it is something I want to ponder on going forward.
